# WhatsApp_Message_Sender
This project automates the process of sending a message to multiple phone numbers on WhatsApp using Selenium and Python. It extracts phone numbers from a WhatsApp group, and saves them to an Excel file. Then, it formats the phone numbers and sends a custom message to each number using the WhatsApp Web interface.
